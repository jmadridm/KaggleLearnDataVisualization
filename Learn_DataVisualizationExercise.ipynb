Which plot is more appropriate to tell this story: the plot from **Step 6**, or the plot from **Step 7**?\n\nHint: Which plot communicates more information? In general, it's good practice to use the simplest plot that tells the entire story of interest.\n\nSolution: In this case, the categorical scatter plot from Step 7 is the more appropriate plot.
